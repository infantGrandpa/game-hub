# Video Game Hub

This video game hub was built using Rawg.io API using TypeScript and React with Chakra UI. The hub is designed to allow you to search for games, filter by system and genre. You can also view more details about a game, such as the description, screenshots, and metacritic ratings.

This hub was built based on Code with Mosh's course: https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part1
